# FaceDetection

<h1> This is Face Detection <h1>

<h2> We are using deep learning <h2>

It works by identifying and measuring facial features in an image. Facial recognition can identify human faces in images or videos, determine if the face in two images belongs to the same person, or search for a face among a large collection of existing images
