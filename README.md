# FaceDetection

<h1> This is Face Detection <h1>

<h2> We are using deep learning <h2>

It works by identifying and measuring facial features in an image. Facial recognition can identify human faces in images or videos, determine if the face in two images belongs to the same person, or search for a face among a large collection of existing images

  <p> Face detection -- also called facial detection -- is an artificial intelligence (AI) based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images. Face detection technology can be applied to various fields -- including security, biometrics, law enforcement, entertainment and personal safety -- to provide surveillance and tracking of people in real time.

Face detection has progressed from rudimentary computer vision techniques to advances in machine learning (ML) to increasingly sophisticated artificial neural networks (ANN) and related technologies; the result has been continuous performance improvements. It now plays an important role as the first step in many key applications -- including face tracking, face analysis and facial recognition. Face detection has a significant effect on how sequential operations will perform in the application.

In face analysis, face detection helps identify which parts of an image or video should be focused on to determine age, gender and emotions using facial expressions. In a facial recognition system -- which maps an individual's facial features mathematically and stores the data as a faceprint -- face detection data is required for the algorithms that discern which parts of an image or video are needed to generate a faceprint. Once identified, the new faceprint can be compared with stored faceprints to determine if there is a match.</p>
